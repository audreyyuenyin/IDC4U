	<h1>--Loans, Mortgages, and Credits--</h1>
    <p> Interest rate of credit can be based on: income, collateral, credit history, personal background and character, amount borrowed, and term of loan</p>
    <h3>Type 1: <strong>Loan, Bank Loan</strong></h3>
    <p>Money borrowed from the bank of financing companies for anything other than property. Require regular payment on principal and interest, and they usually are open loans (can pay off at anytime without penalty)</p>
    <h3>Type 2: <strong>Line of Credit</strong></h3>
    <p>Pre-approved credit for up to a certain amount that can be used by the borrower at anytime. Require regular payment on interest only, variable rate because there is no fixed time for borrowing.</p>
    <h3>Type 3: <strong>Mortgage</strong> </h3>
    <p>Money borrowed to purchase property. Require regular payment on both principal and interest. Downpayment of 5%-20% must be paid; if less than 20% is paid, the mortgage must be insured through <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/index.cfm">Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation</a> in case of default. The lender has the right to foreclose and sell the property if the borrower is unable to pay off the loan.</p>
    <p> 4 current government regulations related to mortgages: 23 years of  amoritization period. borrow a maximum of 80% value of the house, a five-year yard stick, and limited government-backed insured mortgages</p>
    <p> Lower amoritization period --> total interests paid will be less, higher mortgage payments</p>
    <p> Accelerated weekly payment: divide the monthly payment by four, which helps borrower to pay off the mortgage faster with less interest charged. </p>
    <h3> Type4: <strong>Credit Card </strong>: Make purchases at various business</h3>
    <p> Monthly payment with all the purchases. Interest will be charged on unpaid payment, and the cardholder may not use the card. Only paying the minimum payment can build the credit rating; only be bad if no payment is paid at all. Credit card companies (Master-Card, Visa, American Express) earn money by earning interests on unpaid principal, a percentage of each purchases paid by retails, and annual/ transaction fee paid by customers.</p>
    <p> 2 things the government has done to regulate credit card companies in order to protect cardholders: the monthly bill must indicate the minium payment and the time to pay off debt.</p>
    <h2> Credit Bureaus:<small> Trans Union, Equifax </small></h2>
    <p>Gather credit history and form a credit report for each individuals. The report is used to give lenders to see when the individual is applying for credit: Lenders pay to see, and the individual has the permission to see it once per year for free. Information include: date of birth and employment, valid address, household bills, collection agencies referrals, public legal proceeding, previous applications for credit, current and past use of credit cards/ loans. which include when account was opened, credit limit if applicable, last date of activity on the account, highest credit amount used, payment/ non-payment history, and credit balance on date last reported. </p>
    <h2> Debts</h2>
    <p> Stay out of debt: No impulse buy. Compare prices. Set a lower credit limit on the card. Be educated. Pay the monthly payment in full. Set a budget. Do not sign up for too many credit cards. Use cash. </p>
    <p> Get out of debt: Stop using credit card. Find a credit counsellor. File a consumer proposal. Refund items. Pay the item with most interest. Increase income. </p>
    <p>Consumer Proposal: a legal document filed by a trustee in bankrupcy, who has confirmed the client is legally insolvent, and  will negotiate a certain percentage that is agreed by more than half of the creditors. Usually the creditors will accept, because it is better to gain something.</p>
    <p>Consolidation loan: a combined loan in order to have a lower interst rate and shorten the pay off period. </p>
    <p>Bankrupcy: if you were not already bankrupt, owed more than $1,000, and unable to pay off the debts even all assets were sold. You must hire a trustee in bankrupcy, and authorize him/her to take care of all your assets. However, some debts are unprotected: Child support, student loans(if you were not graduated for more than 7 years), court fee, debt arising from fraud, and court awards for damages. During bankrupcy, you must attend counselling sessions, turn over all credit cards, disclose all assets, inform business partners that you are bankrupt. </p>
