	    <h1>--Economic Activity--</h1>
    <h2> <strong>Inflation</strong>, refers to the general increase in prices of goods and services in an economy, decrease purchasing power. Can be calculated using current cosumer price index minus previous consumer price index divided by previous consumer price index. </h2>
    <p> Deflation is bad for the economy, as it delays consumer's purchasing and therefore lower the GDP. </p>
    <p>Consumer Price Index is calculated what it cost consumers to buy 600 goods and services at different period of time. Price volatility items are not included, only the core indexes.  The top four major components in the basket are: Shelter, Food, Transportation, and household operations. </p>
    <p>Problems when calculating CPI: sample size is small, new products are not added, the basket is updated too slow (2 years), retail competitors are not added, nor consumer's behaviors are specified.</p>
    <p>Who suffers in cost-push inflation (When business costs increase, they pass onto the consumers as an increase in price)? Workers, if their wages do not keep up with the inflation. Retired or Fixed-income earners, if their retirement or investments are not indexed in inflation. Lenders, if their term of loan is not yet matured. Investors, if their earnings are less than inflation rate. </p>
    <p>What contributes to demand-pull inflation (When consumers are more willing and able to purchase goods and/or services, higher prices will be charged)? Increase in income, increase in population, increase in the amount of job, decrease in taxation, and decrease in borrowing costs. </p>
    <p>Control inflation: 1.Fiscal policy, by Canadian government. Possible ways are controlling wages, spending on infrastructure/ walfare/ social programs, controlling tax (provincial, manicipal). 2.Monetary policy, by Bank of Canada. Possible ways are controlling overnight lending rates, quantitative easing.</p>

        <h2>Economic Indicators</h2>
        <p>Type1: <strong>Leading indicators</strong>: predict where the economy is going. Housing starts, commodity prices, stock prices, and composite indicators.</p>
        <p>Type2: <strong>Coincident indicators</strong>: confirm the stage of the business cycle the economy is currently in. GDP, retail sales.</p>
        <p>Type3: <strong>Lagging indicators</strong>: confirm the stage of the business cycle the economy was previously in. Business investment, inflation.</p>
        <h2>Exchange Rate</h2>
        <p>Geneate <strong>demand</strong> of Canadian dollars: <strong>foreign investors and purchasers of Canada's export</strong>- who wish to invest in Canada have to convert currencies into Canadian dollars.<strong> Speculators</strong>- who expect the value of Canadian dollars will drop in the future. <strong>Canadian government</strong>- who buy many Canadian dollars using foreign currencies (dirty float).</p>
        <p>Generate <strong>supply</strong> of Canadian dollars: <strong>Importers and investors</strong>- who have to convert Canadian dollars into foreign currencies in order to purchase import and invest in foreign investments. <strong>Speculators</strong>- who expect the value of Canadian dollars will increase in the future. <strong>Central Banks</strong>- who sell many Canadian dollars and buy foreign currencies. </p>
        <h2>Unemployment</h2>
        <p>Problems when measuring unemployment rate: illegal workers are not accounted for (overstate), less-than-one-hour workers are counted as employed (understate), temporary workers are counted as employed (understate), people lie they are discouraged workers (understate), people lie they are actively looking for jobs (overstate), and people lie they are not actively looking for jobs (understate)</p>
        <p>Types of unemployment: 1.Seasonal: they are hired once a year 2.Fictional: they are actively changing jobs 3.Structural: their skills are not updated/ useless to the company 4.Cyclical- related to the business cycle</p>
